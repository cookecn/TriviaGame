# About
* TriviaGame is my fifth homework assignment for the Vanderbilt University Coding Bootcamp. This project has us creating another game, this time using timers! The goal of this assignment is to create a page that uses timers to manage the time the user has to complete the "game". This trivia game should have clickable answers (which will change when another answer is selected) and the answers will be stored to score the user. 

# Contributions
* As of now, this repository should only be changed/altered via Vanderbilt University professors and TA's from the bootcamp.
